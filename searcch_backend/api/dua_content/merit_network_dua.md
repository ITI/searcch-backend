<hr /><br>
The following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement (collectively, the "AGREEMENT", or, "Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)" for all datasets made available to You by Merit Network, Inc. (Merit), a non-profit, research and education network governed by Michiganâ€™s public universities. Certain datasets may have additional Supplemental provisions. References to this AGREEMENT shall include any and all relevant Supplemental provisions.

Merit has the authority and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse requests for dataset(s) or discontinue further access and use to anyone. If you feel your request is inappropriately denied please contact Merit by sending a message to research@merit.edu.

**In consideration for requesting and receiving access to Merit dataset(s), You acknowledge that You understand and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT. Any violation of this AGREEMENT may result in the immediate suspension or termination of this AGREEMENT and/or other action entitled by law such as injunctive or equitable relief. You are individually liable and responsible for compliance with this AGREEMENT. This AGREEMENT is legally binding under the laws of the State of Michigan, United States.**

You may terminate this Agreement by contacting Merit in writing and receiving acknowledgement of such request.

## **1. LICENSE**

Merit's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non- assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this AGREEMENT solely for the purpose of non-profit research and non-profit education, or for government purposes by or on behalf of the U.S. Government. No license is granted for any other purpose and there are no implied licenses in this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of approval by Merit and shall remain in force for a period of one year, unless terminated earlier or amended in writing. Merit shall have the right to use any of Your feedback received during the license period solely for its non-profit educational and/or research purposes.

## **2. GENERAL CONDITIONS**

+ You will not impersonate any individual or entity, misrepresent any affiliation with another person, entity or association, use false information, or otherwise conceal Your identity from Merit at any time for any purpose.
+ You consent that Merit can make public or otherwise disclose Your name as the registered requestor, the name of Your Affiliated Institution, the name of the dataset(s) that Merit has made available to You under this AUA, and the brief description of the type of research being undertaken that You provided to Merit.
+ You will abide by any and all modifications. If a modification occurs, it will be explicitly communicated to You via Your registered email address and shall become effective fifteen (15) days after the transmission of such notification. Your continued access to or use of the data after such time shall indicate Your assent to any and all modification(s). If You do not agree to comply with the modification(s), You agree that You will: 
  - inform Merit immediately, at at which point Your access to the data will be terminated and no longer authorized; and, 
  - no longer access or use this data.
+ You will not probe, interact or attempt to communicate with any host or entity that can potentially be identified by the datasets provided to You.

## **3. USE RESTRICTIONS**

**If You have any concerns or questions about these restrictions, You are encouraged to contact Merit management via email to research@merit.edu. To obtain an exemption from any of these restrictions, You will need a written authorization from Merit management.**

+ While using non-anonymized data set(s), You will respect the privacy of persons that may be identified in the data. For any publication or other disclosure, You will anonymize or de-identify personally- identifiable information, IP addresses, and other data identified in Supplemental provisions (if any) by using commonly accepted techniques such as replacing with zeros the last 11 bits of the IP address. Other recommended methods by the security research community can be found here: http://www.caida.org/projects/predict/anonymization.
+ While using anonymized data set(s), You will not attempt to reverse engineer, decrypt, de-anonymize, derive or otherwise re-identify anonymized information.
+ You will not distribute, disclose, transfer or otherwise make available the dataset(s) to any person other than those employed by your institute who are assisting or collaborating with You using the dataset(s). Other entities with whom You are collaborating in research using the dataset(s) must request access to the dataset(s) separately and directly from Merit.
+ All conditions, restrictions and obligations attached to this data shall accompany any and all subsequent uses and disclosures of this dataset by You. Therefore, You are personally and fully responsible for communicating this AUA and ensuring its compliance as to any and all users described above to whom You make the data available.

## **4. USE OBLIGATIONS**

+ If You create a publication (including web pages, papers published by a third party, and publicly
available presentations) using data from this dataset, You must provide Merit with a copy of (or a link to)
the publication and You must cite the data as follows:  
*The Merit Network, Inc. <span id="dataset_name">[Dataset Name]</span> - <span id="dataset_date">[dates used]</span>  
https://www.merit.edu*
+ At the end of the research, or semi-annually (whichever is sooner), You will report a summary of the research and any findings/conclusions to Merit. This information is used in reports to our funding agencies.
+ You agree to expunge any and all copies of the received Dataset(s) upon completion or termination of stated research and/or termination of data access or use. Completion of stated research shall allow for a reasonable period of time that You may need to retain the dataset(s) in order to satisfy scientific reproducibility obligations.

## **5. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT**

+ You agree to safeguard any and all sensitive data as required, or may be required, by law by using at least the same degree of care that You use for Your own data of a like nature but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to protect the confidentiality of data and/or the privacy of any identifiable person and to prevent its unauthorized disclosure and use. Data is confidential if it is marked as such, if by its nature or content is reasonably distinguishable as confidential, or if You have reasonable cause to believe that its disclosure to a third party would cause harm or damage.  
<br>Data is not confidential, and therefore not sensitive if: 
    - You already knew the data before it was disclosed to You by Merit 
    - You gain subsequent knowledge of the data by either lawfully obtaining it from another source under no obligation of confidentiality, or You develop it independently
    - the data isor becomes generally available to the public through no wrongful act of You or any other party
    - it is required to be disclosed under applicable law, regulation or court order provided You notify Merit prior to making such a disclosure so that Merit may take appropriate action.
<br><br>
+ You will notify Merit immediately of all relevant details if:
    - confidentiality or privacy is compromised; or 
    - You receive any legal, investigatory, or other government demand to reverse engineer, decrypt, de-anonymize or otherwise disclose anonymized or confidential data; or 
    - Your organization was a victim of data breach.
<br><br>
+ If requested, You will provide Merit evidence of compliance with this AGREEMENT, such as a written description of Your data protection plan or a written affirmation that You have disposed of any and all copies of the received dataset from all systems reasonably known to you.
<br><br>
+ DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. MERIT USES ITS BEST EFFORTS TO PROVIDE DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY. HOWEVER, THE DATA PROVIDED HEREIN IS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. NEITHER MERIT, ITS RESEARCHERS, RESEARCH PARTNERS, LICENSORS, AND DATA PROVIDERS MAKE ANY WARRANTY, EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF MERIT DATA, APPLICATIONS, OR SERVICES ACCESSIBLE THROUGH OR MADE AVAILABLE BY MERIT.  
<br>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS MERIT FROM ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, COSTS, JUDGMENTS, DAMAGES, LOSSES AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USE OF THE DATA BY YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL MERIT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE DATA.
